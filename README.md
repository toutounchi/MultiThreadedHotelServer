Hotel Reservation System
This is a simple hotel reservation system implemented in Java. The system allows users to make reservations, check room availability, and cancel existing reservations for a single room in a hotel for the month of March.

Features:
Reservation Management: Users can request a reservation for any set of days in March, provided the room is available and the user doesnâ€™t already have an existing reservation.
Availability Check: Users can check the availability of the room for each day in the month.
Cancellation: Users can cancel their reservations at any time.
Server-Client Architecture: The application consists of a multi-threaded server that handles client requests, allowing for multiple clients to interact with the reservation system simultaneously.
Components:
Hotel Class: Represents the hotel and manages room availability and reservations for the month of March.
HotelClient Class: A console-based client that allows users to interact with the hotel reservation system by entering commands to check availability, make reservations, or cancel them.
HotelServer Class: A server that listens for incoming client connections, processes commands from the client, and communicates with the hotel reservation system.
HotelService Class: Handles the execution of commands for each client, running in a separate thread to allow concurrent processing.
Command List:
USER: Registers a user with the system.
AVAIL: Displays the availability of the room for the entire month.
RESERVE: Makes a reservation for a specified range of days (start and end dates).
CANCEL: Cancels any existing reservation for the user.
QUIT: Ends the session and closes the connection.
How to Run:
Start the server by running the HotelServer class.
Start the client by running the HotelClient class.
Follow the prompts to make a reservation, check availability, or cancel your reservation.
